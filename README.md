# pushingTrees
Intro to decision trees and gradient boosting

Continuing our theme from last meetup's on clustering, we will look at a supervised machine learning method using decision trees. Decision trees can be used for both regression and classification, and are often the bread and butter of machine learning tasks. There are a number of different ways of doing both, however, one tool to help improve the predictions of your models is via gradient boosting. Gradient boosting is a great tool for improving your models, and is often used to improve decision trees.
